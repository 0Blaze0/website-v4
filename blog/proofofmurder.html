      <p>
        Welcome, students of __________________! If you are reading this, you probably know who I am. Yes, I know how to add to 3kh0.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate that everyone is using my links for the website! It is really awesome seeing that because of some kid that has 3kh0 on Discord and knows how to write a crappy HTML page or some half-arse python script is getting all this attention for doing this as if im your hero.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, just know that it is not hard to do this. In fact, I could probably teach my dad how to add a game to 3kh0. You all dont have to give me so much attention and compliments for this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
      Last thing, PLEASE DONT USE MY PROXY LINKS!!!!! When yall share the link to the various proxies I make, it really overwhelmes me for some reason. For some reason I just get overwhelmed by all the attention and maintenence of the websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, credit to 3kh0 and all the other contributors of this amazing website for making it to where we can play cookie clicker in the middle of a test.
      </p>
